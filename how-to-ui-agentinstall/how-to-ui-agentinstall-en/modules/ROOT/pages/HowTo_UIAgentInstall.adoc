= IKAN ALM Agent UI Installation

== Purpose

When build or deploy actions are planned on a local or remote
environment which requires interaction with the target system, an IKAN
ALM Agent must be installed on that machine. This technical document
explains how to do an installation of an IKAN ALM Agent through the IKAN
ALM web application.

[NOTE]
====
The term “remote environment” refers to a system different from
the IKAN ALM Server system. A local build or deploy will happen on the
IKAN ALM Server machine itself.
====

As a consequence, this document can be used for different purposes, so
check if the following situation applies to you:

• You have installed the IKAN ALM Demo (which installs both the Server
and the Agent daemon on a Tomcat webserver/Karaf OSGi container) and you
want to run builds and/or deployments on a different machine than the
one on which you installed the IKAN ALM Demo.
+
Note that for a demo installation we run both the Agent and the Server
inside the Java VM of the same OSGi container, which is not the
recommended configuration of a production system, as a heavy,
memory-intensive build can cause your OSGi container to stop functioning
due to OutOfMemory errors.

• You have installed or you are installing the IKAN ALM Server and want
to install (together with the Server installation or as a separate
installation) an IKAN ALM agent on the same machine, so that you can run
local builds (even deployments in some cases) on the Server machine.
This is the advised way of running local builds.

• You have installed the IKAN ALM Server and you want to install an IKAN
ALM Agent on a different, remote machine, so that you can run
distributed builds, or deploy and control remote machines.

== Prerequisites

=== Hardware Requirements

• RAM: minimum 512MB (megabytes), recommended 1GB (gigabytes) or more.
+
Note that these are just indicative values. The amount of RAM needed by a machine that runs an ALM Agent greatly depends on the amount of resources needed by the build and deploy scripts and custom phases used by the projects that are being built and deployed on it.

• Disk Storage Space: minimum 1 GB (gigabytes).
+
There is no hard and fast rule for disk storage space. The footprint of
a bare installed IKAN ALM Agent (with distribution files) is under 180
MB (megabytes). The actual amount an Agent will require depends on the
number and the size of the projects managed with this agent, and the
size of the resources needed to run a build or deployment. More projects
and larger build results mean more required disk space.

=== A Java 11(LTS) JDK

All IKAN ALM 5.9 components need a Java 11 Development Kit (JDK).

IKAN ALM Agent has been tested to run with Oracle Java, Adoptium Eclipse Temurin (formerly AdoptOpenJDK) Azul Zulu Builds of OpenJDK and OpenJdk on several Linux distros. Oracle Java can be obtained from Oracle's website for non-production environments using an Oracle account. Adoptium OpenJDK can be obtained from https://adoptium.net[https://adoptium.net,window=_blank] and Azul Zulu Builds of the OpenJDK from https://azul.com/downloads/?package=jdk[https://azul.com/downloads/?package=jdk,window=_blank].

=== PowerShell (Windows) or SSH (Windows/Linux/Unix) Connection

The UI IKAN ALM Agent Installation is managed and pushed from the IKAN
ALM Server to the (remote) Agent Machine. This may be done through a
PowerShell (Windows) or SSH Connection (Windows, Linux or Unix). Both
connection types need a User and Authentication data in order to operate
on the Agent Machine. This User needs sufficient Access Rights on the
Machine: write files, create directories, install and run services or
daemons, etc. See further for more details about the specific operations
and connection parameters.

When opting for the *SSH Connection* type, the target Agent machine must
be running an SSH server. It is advised to test the connection from the
IKAN ALM Server to the target Agent Machine before attempting an Agent
installation. This can be done in a command shell or with an SSH Client
like OpenSSH client outside the scope of IKAN ALM. This assures that the
_known_hosts_ file and other SSH details are correctly configured.

The *PowerShell Connection* type needs minimum PowerShell Version *5* installed on the IKAN ALM Server and some specific Security settings
on both the IKAN ALM Server and Agent Machine.

On the IKAN ALM Server the PowerShell execution policy should be set to
_Unrestricted._ If this is not the case, it can be obtained by running
following command in an elevated PowerShell prompt:

[source]
----
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope LocalMachine
----

The scope should be set to _LocalMachine_ to allow the IKAN ALM Server
running as a Windows service under the Local System Account to run
PowerShell scripts.

On the target IKAN ALM Agent Machine PowerShell remoting needs to be
enabled. Run following command from an elevated PowerShell prompt if it
should be changed:

[source]
----
Enable-PSRemoting
----

This is needed so that the remote Agent machine accepts remote
PowerShell sessions.

It is also important that the PowerShell User has *Administrative
rights* to be able to install/uninstall the IKAN ALM Agent as a Windows
service.

=== HTTP or HTTPS Connection with IKAN ALM Server

The communication between the Server and the Agent daemons is done over
XML-RPC. This means that IKAN ALM enables distributed computing (remote
procedure calls) using HTTP or HTTPS as the transport protocol and XML
for the encoding (for more information, refer to
http://www.xmlrpc.com[www.xmlrpc.com,window=_blank]. In order to
enable XML-RPC interaction, the target machine for the new Agent must
have a correct TCP/IP connection to the __Server machine__.

=== Scripting Tool

In order to execute a build or deploy script on the remote machine, the
correct scripting tool must be installed on the target Agent system.
IKAN ALM supports Ant, Gradle, NAnt and Maven2 as scripting tools. Other
scripts (Perl, make, …) can be easily called via these supported
scripting tools.

Contact IKAN ALM support if more information is
needed. Check the different websites
http://ant.apache.org[http://ant.apache.org,window=_blank],
http://gradle.org[http://gradle.org,window=_blank],
http://maven.apache.org[http://maven.apache.org,window=_blank] and
http://nant.sourceforge.net[http://nant.sourceforge.net,window=_blank]) for
downloading and installing the appropriate scripting tool.


[NOTE]
====
The installation of the Agent can be launched without any
scripting tool installed on the target machine. It is no problem to
install and configure the scripting tool after the Agent is up and
running.
====

== IKAN ALM Agent UI Installation

The IKAN ALM Agent UI Installation can be configured, started and
managed from within the IKAN ALM Web Application. After you have created
the Machine definition in _Global Administration_, an _Install_
functionality is available in the _Global Administration > Machines
Overview._ Selecting it will open the _Agent Install Configuration_ UI.
After configuring the *General* and *SecureShell* or *PowerShell*
installation details the Agent Installation can be started and followed
up on this page. Depending on the chosen *Connection Type* the IKAN ALM
Server will automate the following steps through a *Secure Shell,* or
execute *PowerShell* scripts that act on the (remote) Agent Machine:

. Create a temporary directory on the IKAN ALM server, copy configurable
Agent installation files to it and replace variables in the installation
files
. Create an Agent Distribution Folder on the remote Machine
. Copy the compressed Agent Distribution File, a compressed Apache ANT
archive and the Agent installation files (Apache ANT script and
properties, cmd and shell files) to the Agent Distribution Folder.
. Launch a cmd or shell prompt that will
.. Verify the JAVA_HOME on the Agent Machine
.. Uncompress the copied Apache ANT archive
.. Start an orchestrating ANT script that will execute steps 5 to 13 on
the Agent Machine
. ANT script: detect the Operating System details of the new Agent
Machine. This is needed to (un)install services or daemons. Currently
Windows, several Linux flavors and AIX are supported. For Linux Redhat
and Debian flavors both Systemd and SystemV are supported
. ANT script: uncompress the agent distribution
. ANT script: Copy installation properties and cmd or shell files
. ANT script: Stop the ALM Agent service or daemon if it is running
. ANT script: Uninstall the previous ALM Agent if requested
. ANT script: Install the new IKAN ALM Agent: it will start a
(different) ANT script, that will perform in the same way as the console
IKAN ALM Agent installation
. ANT script: Register the IKAN ALM Agent as a Windows service or Linux
daemon
. ANT script: Start the registered service or daemon
. ANT script: cleanup temporary directories
. Finally delete the files that were copied in step 3. This action will
always run, even if some of the previous steps failed, or if the
installation was cancelled or aborted

Before the installation can be started, *General* fields and
*SecureShell* or *PowerShell* connection parameters should be filled
out.

====
In the Global Administration context, select *_Machines > Overview_*

Click the image:icons/image3.png[,16,16] *_Install_* link on the *_Machines Overview_* panel next to the Machine you want to Install an Agent on.

Fill out the fields in the *_Installation Configuration_* panel. Fields
marked with a red asterisk are mandatory
====

If the _"Display Form Help"_ option is activated, an inline description
will be shown for each of the fields.

=== General Installation Fields

[cols="1,1", frame="topbot", options="header"]
|===
|Field
|Explanation

|Java Home
|The location of the Java Virtual Machine used to launch the Agent.

This should be a Java 11 JDK.

For example:  `D:/java/jdk11.0.10` or `/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk`.

*Note:* On Unix or Linux systems, specify the path of the real Java
installation (and not to a symlink), as the installation will verify the
existence of specific jars under the provided path.

|Agent Installation Location
|This is the location where the Agent will be installed, e.g.,
`/opt/ikan/alm` or `C:/alm`.

Further on in this guide we will refer to this location as ALM_HOME.

|Agent Distribution Folder
|The location on the Agent Machine where the Agent Installation files
should be copied to. e.g., `/opt/ikan/agentdistro` or `C:/ikan/alm/agent
distribution`

It is recommended to make this directory different from the Agent Installation Location, and not make it a subdirectory, for example.
After a successful installation the used installation files will be
stored in a _current_ subdirectory of this location.

|Secure Server-Agent Communication
|Flag to specify secure communication between the ALM Server and Agent.

|Agent Port
|Optional, defaulted to the value of the Machine definition.

The port the Agent will be listening on. The default value is ”20020”.

If you change this value, you will also have to change the ”Agent Port”
property of the Machine representing this Agent in the IKAN ALM GUI.

|Server Hostname
|Optional, defaulted to the value of the Machine definition.

The hostname (or IP address) of the IKAN ALM Server machine.

The Agent will try to connect to the Server by using this name or IP
address.

|Server Port
|Optional, defaulted to the value of the Machine definition.

The port the IKAN ALM Server is listening on.

The Agent will try to connect to the Server on this port. The setting
can be verified in the IKAN ALM Global administration:

Go to _Global Administration > System Settings_

Panel _Local Environment_: the value of “IKAN ALM Server” represents the
IKAN ALM Server Machine

Go to _Global Administration > Machines > Overview_

Check the “Server Port” property of the IKAN ALM Server Machine. If no
Server Port is defined on the ALM Server Machine, port 20021 will be
used.

|Agent Hostname
|Optional.

Leave this field empty unless you want to override the automatically
detected hostname of the Agent.

For example, to use a fully qualified domain name like
`almAgent.your.domain` for communicating with the IKAN ALM server. It is
important that the hostname entered here matches the DHCP name of the
Agent Machine (in the IKAN ALM GUI).

|Agent IP Address
|Optional.

Leave this field empty unless you want to override the automatically
detected IP address of the Agent.

For example, to use an IP Address which differs from the internal IP
address for communicating with the IKAN ALM server. It is important that
the IP address entered here matches the IP address of the Agent Machine
(in the IKAN ALM GUI).
|===

The following first three fields are the port numbers specific to the
Karaf container hosting the IKAN ALM Agent daemon. Normally, there is no
need to change those port numbers unless you have port conflicts. For
more information, refer to the Karaf Container 4.0 documentation: https://karaf.apache.org/manual/latest/#_instances[https://karaf.apache.org/manual/latest/#_instances,window=_blank]

 

[cols="1,1", frame="topbot", options="header"]
|===
|Field
|Explanation

|Agent Karaf RMI Registry Port
|The Karaf RMI registry port.

The default value is “1099”.

|Agent Karaf RMI Server Port
|The Karaf RMI server port.

The default value is “44444”.

|Agent Karaf SSH Port
|The Karaf SSH port.

The default value is “8101”.

|Agent Karaf Logfile Path 
|Relative path to the Karaf log of the IKAN ALM Agent log.

This setting is used by the IKAN ALM Server when displaying the Machine
Log of an Agent on the Machine Detailed Status screen.

|Run Agent Uninstaller
|Flag to indicate if the uninstallation process should run first to
uninstall the previously installed IKAN ALM agent.

The default value is “Yes”.

|Agent Uninstaller location
|Optional.

Location of the Uninstaller for manually installed Agents.

There is no need to set this for Agents that have been installed using
this page.

You need to set this if you want the installation procedure to
automatically uninstall an Agent that was previously installed manually.
For example, if an ALM 5.8 Agent was installed using the console
installer, you need to set this field to the location of that console
installer, like: `C:/ikan/install/IKAN_ALM_5.8_console`

The installation procedure will detect the version of the Agent and stop
and remove the old Agent service. Note that this will only work a) if the
Agent service was installed using its default service name and b) if the _uninstall.properties_ from the console installer contains the correct values for uninstalling the Agent.

|Agent Stop/Start Timeout
|Timeout in seconds to wait for the Agent service to stop or start.

|Connection type
|Connection Type between the IKAN ALM Server and the target Agent
Machine. Possible options are SSH (SecureShell) or PowerShell. After you
have selected the Connection type, the appropriate _SecureShell_ or
_PowerShell_ panel will be displayed underneath..
|===

=== Connection Fields
